This is the Center for Digital Archaeology processing pipeline (sometimes called stream). It is a folder structure we've used for media management and workflows for projects and operations since 2011. The folders in this series are meant to represent the different steps we take to manage media before it is published.\
\
The gaps between the numbers represented in this folder represent the flexible parts of the workflow which are different for each project.\
\
We ask that you first contact the Center for Digital Archaeology before sharing or publishing this workflow with others.
