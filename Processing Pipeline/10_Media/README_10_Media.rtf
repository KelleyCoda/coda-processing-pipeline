\f0\fs24 \cf0 10 Media is where any converted, but untouched files are stored. For example, a file was submitted as an NEF in 03_Media_IN, then it is copied as a DNG into Lightroom. The DNG is stored in this folder in the file structure established in 03, but if I make any metadata or development changes, they will not be written back to this file, instead they go in 12_Published.}
